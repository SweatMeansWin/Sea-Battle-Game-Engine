I have written own game engine for Sea Battle game.
It has module architecture.
The game engine using a GameView instance to show UI and receiving data from player or bot.
At the moment it is console GameView which draw battle fields using ASCII charset.
It can draw every step or just returning result through method
There are also independent modules for:
    placing ships in the battle field (auto [in several ways] or manually)
    shooting enemy (auto [in several ways] or manually)
It's easy write your own ship generator or shooter to compare it
Next steps:
    There are too much possible improvements in ships/shoot algorithms (maybe later)
    Im going to read book about blockchain and rewrite platform in this concept
    There are perfect possibilities for Neural networking to answer for the best tactics
